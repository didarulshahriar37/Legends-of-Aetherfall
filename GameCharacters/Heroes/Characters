>>Archer:  swift and silent, trained in forest warfare and beast communion. They have a balanced health and damage capacity. They can shoot a single or multiple arrows at a time. Multiple arrows will damage the enemy twice.

>>Warrior: resilient and fearless, wielding enchanted steel and the honor of ancient lineages. They have the highest health among all factions. They can shield themselves from any attack, but the shield will work only if the enemy has less health power than the warrior.
